The 'service' command does not exit until the service receives a signal.
This is typically run from launchd (Mac), systemd or init (Linux), a Windows
service harness (Windows), etc.

If 'set' is followed by a 16-digit hex number it will get/set network config
options. Otherwise it will get/set local options that pertain to the entire
node.

Identities can be specified verbatim on the command line or as a path to
a file. This is detected automatically.
